👀 I’m interested in Data Science and excited about leveraging data to drive insights and decision-making.
🌱 I’m learning Python to enhance my programming skills and explore machine-learning libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
💻 I have experience with SQL for database management, Excel for data manipulation and analysis, and Power BI for data visualization, which I believe will be valuable as I transition into data science.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving predictive modeling, data visualization, or innovative data-driven solutions. I believe that working with others can help me grow and learn faster.
